# Why CUDA Code is Usually Unreadable
The CUDA code is usually hard to read, and hard to debug, because the programmer needs to deal with many low-level abstractions in CUDA programming, such as:

+ dealing with raw pointers.
+ explicitly deal with shared memory.


# Best Practice to Write Readable CUDA code

## Pass struct to functions when possible

For example, we can use:
```C
typedef struct {
  int width;
  int height;
  float*Â elements;
} Matrix;
```

## Give shared memory meaningful names
